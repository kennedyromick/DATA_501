# DATA 501 Project - Beyond the Track: Analyzing Safety Car Incients in Formula 1 for Enhanced Race Strategy

By: Akib Hasan Aryan and Kennedy Romick

## About the Project

### Objective: 
Investigate patterns, trends, and causal factors surrounding safety car incidents in F1 races
### Aims:
1. Answer when and why safety cars are deployed
2. Indentify correlations among incidents properties
3. Develop a predictive model
### Research Questions:
1. Under what conditions do safety cars occur most often?
2. Are there correlations between specific incident properties during safety car periods?
3. How can historical safety car incident data be leveraged to predict the probability of safety car deployments at different stages of future races?
### Input Data: 
- F1 Race Data from FastF1 (https://docs.fastf1.dev/index.html)
### Features: 
- Displays an interactive Parallel Coordinate Plot
- Runs a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probability of a safety car occuring
